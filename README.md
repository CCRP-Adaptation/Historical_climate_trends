Historical trend analysis

# DESCRIPTION
Moving historical trend analysis (PRISM in the past) into own repository, out of climate futures. They have been lumped together because they are part of what is produced for RSS engagements, but as we produce climate data for a broader set of applications, it will be easier if climate futures and historical trends are run separately.
